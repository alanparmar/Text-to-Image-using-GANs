# Text_to_Image
Generate images from text description using Attn GAN

Created as a Final Year Project by grp of 4. This project uses Generative Adversarial networks (GANs) to produce realistic images based on descriptive text provided.
The Dataset chosen is that of birds.

GAN works on two models (Generator Model and Discriminator Model) contesting each other in a form of zero sum game. 
- The Generator Model interprets text and generates realistic looking images, trying to fool the Discriminator model.
- The Discriminator Model polices the images generated by Generator and if the images are not real looking, it discards the image, forcing the cycle to repeat.

Model coded in Python, frontend in HTML and css.
Data can be found in "./data/".
Images generated are stored in "./static/generated_images/".
